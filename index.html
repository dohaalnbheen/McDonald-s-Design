                                McDonald's has more than thirty thousand branches for selling fast food spread in more
                                than one hundred and twenty countries in the world, where about four hundred and sixty
                                thousand workers work in those branches.

                                McDonald's annual return exceeded all expectations, as the net profit return after
                                accounting for expenses and consumables and damaged materials amounted to approximately
                                one billion and sixty million dollars each year.

                                McDonald's sales are not affected by the bad economic conditions around the world,
                                whether it is a period of recession or recovery, the only thing that affects its sales
                                is the continued implementation of its own methods that make it able to withstand and
                                challenge its competitors from other companies.
